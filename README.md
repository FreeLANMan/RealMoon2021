# RealMoon2021
Game mod for Minetest 5.4.1 simulating Moon colonization

You are selected to be one of the first settlers in a Moon colony and have the mission of surviving in this new world. The habitat is ready to use and you (supposed to) have the tools that you need. You start at the Tycho crater, LQ26 quadrangle, Nearside, Moon. Good Luck!

Focus: Single player simulation, LAN multiplayer.

Features:

    Real Moon topography with NASA data (mapgen by Alexander R. Pruss)
    Real Moon gravity
    Vacuum (adapted from mod by BuckarooBanzay)
    Notebook (https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=17910)
    Some machines with the Technic mod (https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=2538)
    Airtanks (mod: https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=17102)
    
New Features 2021:

    Meteors
    Simple geology: (The location is based on the real moon's albedo.)
    - minerals: regolith, highFeOregolith, lowFeOregolith, ice, basalt(drop cobble). 
    New recipes:
    - bucket_empty + ice -> water bucket 
    - regolith x4 -> high FeO regolith (+lowFeOregolith x3) 
    - highFeOregolith + cook -> moldedregolith
    
Possibles future features:

    Real Moon geology
    Space radiation
    Vacuum propagation
    Transportation system
    
Tips:

    Use the airpump to eliminate the vacuum inside a building.
    Use the aircompressor to recharge the air tanks.
    Soil becomes gravel in contact with vacuum.
    Make another habitat.

Installation:

    Just download and extract the zip file in the /games/ directory of the Minetest.
    Tests made only in the 5.4.1 Minetest version.
